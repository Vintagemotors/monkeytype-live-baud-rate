Just copy the content from the version you want to use into your userscript manager and refresh the monkeytype page and your good to go!

It requires your monkeytype to be set to display everything in CPM. I could make a version to calculate based off of WPM but it would be less accurate and I always use CPM personally. 

Tested on Firefox Developer 124.0b3, confirmed NOT working on latest Brave stable. Other browsers not tested.

Confirmed working on Supermium 126.0.6478.261

Known issues: If you switch to another tab without a test in progress you will have to refresh the page for it to appear again.
